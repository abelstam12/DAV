Linear regression within the dataset:

1.
    sjv = c1 * Aantal_aansluitingen + c2 * POSTCODE_VAN:
    Coefficients:
    [[0.11735776 0.1230185 ]]
    Mean squared error: 54185102.24
    Variance score: -0.43
    not very promissing..
2. 
    SJV = c1 * Aantal_aansluitingen
    Coefficients:
    [[-2.41296324]]
    Mean squared error: 53081252.98
    Variance score: -0.40
    :(
3. 
    SJV_GAS = c1 * Aantal_aansluitingen + c2 * POSTCODE_VAN:
    Coefficients:
    [[ 0.14165485 -0.0686829 ]]
    Mean squared error: 11613129.08
    Variance score: -0.36
    :(
4. 
    SJV_GAS = c1 * Aantal_aansluitingen
    Coefficients:
    [[-3.85388348]]
    Mean squared error: 11385563.73
    Variance score: -0.34

Clearly something smarter is needed to make a nice linear regression. A profile was made by Lauren
specifying consumption for postal codes. Some regions show peaks. We will catagorize the 
postal codes by 'centrum', 'industie', 'nieuwbouw' and OUD_ZUID, since we suspect the homes there are mostly very large and old, and do a regression with the latter as describing variables.
(0 if not in catagory and 1 if in catagory). We suspect gas usage is most interesting, since its use is mostly dependent
on the building.
