Findings data EDA:
    GEMIDDELD VERBUIK GAS EN ELECTRA IN AMSTERDAM 2009 - 2018:
    - electricity and gas consumption over the years seem te be correlated in the verbruik vs jaar plot
    it may be interesting to analyse this further and maybe scale electricity usage by the 'teruglever percentage'
    - maybe there is a total increase in the 'teruglever percentage' which can account for the decrease
    in elc usage
    - The decrease in gas consumption may be correlated with the amount of solar cells used to heat water etc
    or it may be that more energy effecient houses are built. The latter is also interesting to analyse.
    - As well as the above, the power consumption can correlate with the average temperature of the years
    - To check this we need to analyse the KNMI weather data
    HISTOGRAMS:
    - it seems that the power usage 'per aansluiting' is spread really wide
    - both the elc and gas usage appear to have some logarithmic scaling
    - when taking the log of the consumption 'per aansluiting' the electicity looks a lot like 
    a normal distribution. This may imply that elc is log normal distributed
    - the gas consumption 'per aansluiting' has the same properties, but with a slight skewness to the left
    - We need to think if this is something of interest
